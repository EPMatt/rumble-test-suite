# How to setup IntelliJ Project assuming all PRE-REQUIREMENTS are installed. 
0. Obtaining the rumble-test-suite repository and its structure 


```
git clone https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/gfourny/rumble-test-suite
cd rumble-test-suite
git checkout maven-framework-project
chmod u+x get-tests-repository.sh
git clone https://gitlab.inf.ethz.ch/gfourny/rumble
cd rumble
git checkout research-project-stevan-mihajlovic
```

1. Open IntelliJ idea and click import project.
2. Double click rumble-test-suite and wait for dependencies to be resolved
3. You will see a problem that Could not find artifact com.github.rumbledb:spark-rumble:pom:1.9.0 in central
4. Full screen IntelliJ idea and go to File->Project Structure (Command + ;)
5. Go to Module and Click on + sign (Command + N) and navigate to the rumble folder and click on it. 
6. Import it as Maven dependency and click next. spark-rumble should appear under rumble test suite
7. Click on rumble test suite and click on dependencies
8. At the end of the list there is another + sign. Click it and select Module dependency...
9. Select spark-rumble one and climb it on top of the list. After clicking okay, IntelliJ will resolve dependency
10. Click again on the + sign. Select JAR or directories.
11. Go to src->main->saxon->command select all 4 .jar files and click okay
12. Open Run.java class, Right-click Debug 'Run.main()'

```
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
arch -x86_64 brew install scala@2.11
arch -x86_64 brew install apache-spark will first install java 11 and then it will download spark 3.0.1 as I failed to specify the version
echo export SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/Cellar/apache-spark/3.0.1/libexec >> ~/.zshrc
echo export PATH="$SPARK_HOME/bin/:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-11.jdk
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openjdk@11/include"
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home) >> ~/.zshrc 
chmod +x /usr/local/Cellar/apache-spark/3.0.1/libexec/bin/*
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/scala@2.11/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc 
echo export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin/:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

#### Java SDK and ZULU SDK
On the brand new Laptop, when running IntelliJ, you might need to setup SDK:
1. Go to [Oracle site for Java 1.8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) and select macOSx64 to get the .dmg file
2. Double click on it -> opens the window with package -> double click on it and install
3. Back in IntelliJ idea click Add SDK -> JDK and select the java version 1.8 one

It seems that M1 chip is not quite running fast with JAVA SDK. That is why we should download ZULU SDK from [here](https://cdn.azul.com/zulu/bin/zulu11.43.1021-ca-jdk11.0.9.1-macosx_aarch64.dmg). Once downloaded, it will be available in Intellij, just repeat same steps choosing the ZULU one

#### Maven and ANT
Rumble required us to install mvn and ant:
```
arch -x86_64 brew install maven
echo export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.6.3_1/bin/:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
arch -x86_64 brew install ant
echo export PATH="/usr/local/Cellar/ant/1.10.9/bin/:$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
```

###### All the commands below need to be run within rumble directory (cd ~/Documents/rumble-test-suite/rumble)
In order to build grammar lexer classes using ant run:
```
ant -buildfile build_antlr_parser.xml generate-parser
cd src/main/java/org/rumbledb/parser
ant -buildfile build_antlr_parser.xml generate-xquery-parser
ant -buildfile build_antlr_parser.xml generate-xquery-lexer
```

In order to build .jar file using mvn run:
```
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```

In order to debug .jar file you need to:
First create the alias and run the command run_rumble_no_static_analysis. This will launch the Rumble in terminal
```
echo alias run_rumble_no_static_analysis="export SPARK_SUBMIT_OPTS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005; spark-submit target/spark-rumble-[0-9.]*-jar-with-dependencies.jar --shell yes" >> ~/.zshrc
run_rumble_no_static_analysis
```
In IntelliJ do following:
1. Click Edit Configuration
2. Command+N
3. From dropdown select Remote JVM Debug
4. It should be prefilled with Host:localhost, Port:5005, Command Line Arguments for remote JVM: -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005
5. Just input the Name and click okay
6. Select the just created configuration and click debug
7. Input something in Rumble and it will hit the breakpoint!

0. Download [spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz](https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.4.6/spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz) 
```
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
echo $JAVA_HOME
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
echo $PATH
java â€“version
cd ~/Downloads
tar -xvf spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
mv spark-2.4.6-bin-hadoop2.7 ~/spark
export SPARK_HOME=$HOME/spark
export PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Personal decision and notes
- Java JDK is a greater set than JRE. JRE is Runtime environment needed for running the application, while JDK is Development Kit needed for developing
- Headless is used for servers and normal one is used for desktops
- Path variables are used when you want to run command. Java's bin should be added to the path in order to be able to use command java
- Some installations need to use Java and they look for it via JAVA_HOME variable, that is why we need to set that one as well
- I did not use sudo apt install default-jdk as this would install version 11 and I was using spark compatible with version 8
- Commands used:(PERFECT GUIDE [HERE](https://vitux.com/how-to-setup-java_home-path-in-ubuntu/))

- I decided to use the 2.4.6 spark and not the 3.0.0 version. Since 2.4.6 only works with java 8, this is why I did not opt out for the default java installation. Also I did not have to install scala as prerequirement, the downloaded installation does it for you.
- To run rumble from terminal (command line), download [spark-rumble-1.8.1.jar](https://github.com/RumbleDB/rumble/releases/download/v1.8.1/spark-rumble-1.8.1.jar) and execute command:
```
spark-submit spark-rumble-1.8.1.jar --shell yes
```
