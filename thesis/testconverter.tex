\chapter{Test Converter}

\todo{Explain that this is a separate Java Application and that the idea is to output JSONiq test suite that can be used to verify any JSONiq implementation and not just Rumble. Clearly Emphasize the separation of Group 1 and Group 3 from the Phase 3 of Implementation}

\todo{Draw a new architecture of this java application if needed and exaplain how we have 2 lists for skipping - one is used in testdriver because we know it will fail and the other will be used in testconverter because it is not JSONiq}

\todo{Insert a step  from commented link below - Steps of Inputs of Understanding Rumble. Explain where do we want to reuse Rumble and how in order to achieve the conversion. How the Expression tree will provide it out of the box and simply we will be able to serialize to JSONiq} %https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=22DCF06E2163AB78%2118160&id=documents&wd=target%28Thesis%2FFor%20the%20report.one%7C8A456F7A-5A75-43D6-87A7-91CC6306A144%2FUnderstanding%20Rumble%7C32B67BA3-8D6F-4849-BEC0-C8C513BE148A%2F%29}

\todo{Explain that we create a new grammar file because we now want to parse XQuery instead. Explain that grammar is complete and that no modifications were needed except labels and couple of things that I have listed}

\todo{Cover everything that was documented in the 11.02 meeting at the end there is chapter for report}
