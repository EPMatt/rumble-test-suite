%Problem
The increasing amount of data available to process in today's world led to the emergence of engines for large-scale data processing such as Spark. In order to make querying more efficient, Rumble is an engine that automatically runs queries on top of Spark, using JSONiq as declarative querying language instead of Spark API. 
%Background
Rumble is still in its beta version and requires a testing mechanism that would verify the behavior of its implementation. 
JSONiq inherits 95\% of its features from XQuery, its XML counterpart. QT3TS is Test Suite with over 30000 test cases designed for testing XQuery.
%Objective
This work aims to create a Test Suite based on QT3TS and implement a Test Driver capable of executing it on top of Rumble to verify its implementation.
%Methods
The work was carried out gradually through several phases of implementation. In each phase, we were improving the implementation of Test Driver and improving Rumble. We also have implemented the necessary XQuery to JSONiq conversion that was required to execute tests. 
%Results
As the final outcome of the work, we have managed to produce JSONiq Test Suite that can be used to verify any implementation, not just Rumble. We have also implemented Test Driver for Rumble. We have made a significant impact on improving the implementation of the Rumble engine.
