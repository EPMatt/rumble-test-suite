\begin{abstract}
	First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Dr Gustavo Alonso and Dr Ghislain Fourny for giving me an opportunity to work with them. Their expertise is undeniable and it is always a special kind of honor working together with people like them. More importantly, I want to thank them for showing empathy and feelings. Gustavo Alonso was the person that guided me through my first semester at ETH. The first semester depression is something every non bachelor ETH student goes through, every single one. Not a single person of more than 10 professors/advisors/psychiatrists/staff at ETH could help me, I felt alone and abandoned. Gustavo is the only one that took his time to truly hear me out and he gave me a worthy advice. I thank Ghislain for being by far one of the best lecturers I have ever seen. The passion I saw for his work is remarkable. It is something that inspired me and restored faith that a person can truly enjoy and love their work. 
	
	I am a very grateful person today, but I was not always like that. I took many things for granted and in order for you to understand the list of people I am grateful to, you should know my story. 
	
	I was born 27 years ago in a war devastated country. Yes I do remember my dad jumping over me and protecting me with his body thinking that house would collapse because tomahawk hit nearby military base. People screaming and running in panic over each other to hide in the basement. Skies being so orange at nights it seemed like a never ending sunset. Yes I do remember being bullied and mistreated by other kids in primary school. Being laughed at for things that were not even true. The injustice and incapability of the system to protect me. Alone, I promised myself I will never be weak again, I had to grow up. Yes I do remember setting an example for everyone. Obtaining numerous awards and recognition's. Finally graduating as the single best MSc student of the entire generation. Yes I do remember leaving the life I was building for 25 years. Coming Switzerland as already defined person, pursuing the dream of ETH and better future for my family, leaving people back home in tears. Quitting my stable job, risking it all with 0 income or support, eating refills of lunch in Polymensa for dinner. Again being mistreated, by flatmate. Being discriminated because of my country of origin. Even though I was not spoiled and used to defeat, I was crying every day, broken, hopeless, depressed. Going to sleep while praying to God not to wake up the next morning. Yes I remember generosity and a hand of salvation. Started building new friendships, engaging in team projects. Getting a 70\% workload job while maintaining my studies. Finally being able to bring my wife to Switzerland. Yes I do remember my cheating ex wife leaving me for rich Swiss boy. Losing my purpose, empty on the inside. Even with the same shell with a fake smile on the outside, people could not recognize me anymore. Not being able to pick up the treads of my old life, time passed, things were not the same. Failed to build a new one, just wandering around like a lost undefined soul. Yes I do remember losing my dad. He survived aneurysm with less than 1\% chances. But he did not survive me leaving, it was grief over me that killed him.
	
	I am not writing this so that you can pity me. I am writing to share the story of how I learned to be grateful.
	
	If you are thinking to quit, do not do it! If you think your life is miserable, it is not! Stop for a moment and look back at your life. Always look back at what you already have. Look at all the privileges you are entitled to but you are taking them for granted. You came to this world as tabula rasa and the world owes you nothing by childbirth. Whatever you already have in life you should consider a blessing, because if life taught me anything, is that in a blink of an eye, you can loose everything. 
	
	In the end, it does not matter what you will achieve. What matters is what kind of life you are going to live. Live every day like it is your last and you will see how simple life is. And if you wake up one day, hating your life and the avatar that you have become, gather strength to reset and start all over again. To everyone that did bad things to me, I can only say thank you. Thank you for making me play game called life in veteran mode. You made me stronger, you made me what I am today. I died and I was reborn more than 5 times, whatâ€™s your excuse? 
	
	The list of people I am grateful to is endless, but I am limited to 2 pages. Whoever is left out, should know that they still have a place in my heart:
